- **Advanced security features** - Basic auth is sufficient

## Technical Considerations

### Database Schema

- ‚úÖ Categories and tags tables exist
- ‚úÖ Media table exists
- All necessary tables are already designed

### Authentication Strategy
- Use session-based authentication (pavex_session already configured)
- Simple username/email + password login
- No need for OAuth or complex auth flows

### Content Management
- Start with simple forms for post creation/editing
- Use existing template system for display
- Focus on functionality over fancy UI initially

## Implementation Notes

### Quick Wins
1. **Authentication** - Reuse existing user model and validation
2. **Posts** - Leverage existing database schema
3. **Templates** - Build on existing template system

### Development Approach
- Focus on functionality over polish initially
- Use existing infrastructure (sessions, templates, database)
- Test as you go (maintain good test coverage)
- Iterate quickly based on actual usage

### Future Considerations
- If the platform grows beyond personal use, revisit skipped features
- Consider performance optimization as content grows
- Evaluate need for advanced features based on actual usage patterns
